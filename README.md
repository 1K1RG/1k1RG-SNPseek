# SNPSeek Code Repository

Welcome to the **SNPSeek** code repository! This repository hosts the source code for processing, analyzing, and visualizing SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data. The primary focus of the project is to transform raw SNP data into visualizable formats, facilitate matrix generation for SNP analysis, and support database loading for large-scale data storage and access.

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

SNPSeek aims to provide tools for the effective transformation of SNP data into matrices and other formats compatible with data analysis and visualization tools. The repository includes scripts for preprocessing raw SNP data, creating HDF5 files for storage, and generating graphical representations for SNP visualization.

Key features include:
- **SNP Data Transformation**: Tools for converting raw SNP data into standardized formats.
- **HDF5 Matrix Generation**: Scripts for creating efficient HDF5 files for matrix-based analysis.
- **Visualization**: Support for visualizing SNP data matrices, including tools for generating heatmaps and other graphical representations.
- **Database Integration**: Features for preparing data to be loaded into relational databases.
